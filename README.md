Phoenix
=======

A multi-system emulator and library manager designed to be both powerful and easy to use. Powered by Qt 5 and Libretro, it is available on Windows, OS X and Linux. Free now and forever under GPL v2.

We've designed Phoenix with the hope that it'll be perfect for everyone, whether you're someone who hardly plays videogames, a hardcore gamer, a speedrunner, or even a homebrew programmer!
